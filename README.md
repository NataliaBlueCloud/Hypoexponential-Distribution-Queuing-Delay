# Hypoexponential Distribution with 3 Links - Simulation and Analysis
This repository contains R Markdown code for simulating and analyzing a system with hypoexponential distribution across three links, as well as functions for calculating delays for a variable number of links (N). The simulation is conducted using the _simmer_ package, and theoretical calculations are performed using _igraph_ and _EnvStats_. The results are visualized using various R packages including _ggplot2_, _ggpubr_, _cowplot_, and _hrbrthemes_.

## Usage
### Input Data
Specify the system parameters such as capacity of the links in Gbps (Capacity_Gbps), load for each link, and the packet size (N).

## Igraph Theoretical Calculations
This section uses the igraph package to perform theoretical calculations and visualize the network graph.

## Simulation and Delay Comparison
The code calculates both theoretical and simulated delays for the three links to compare the results.

# n-Number of Links Functions and Calculation example
This section contains functions for calculating the theoretical and simulated delays for a system with a variable number of links (_n_).

# Installation and Setup
Before running the code, ensure that you have the required R packages installed:

- igraph
- simmer
- dplyr

You can install these packages using the install.packages() function in R.
```R
install.packages(c("igraph", "simmer", "dplyr"))
```

# Results
The results of the simulation and analysis are presented in the code output and visualizations generated by the R code.
